              Analysis:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is a relatively linear correlation between obesity and poverty, with that correlation increasing (or at least a reduction in outliers) between smoking and poverty.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The median age tends to fall between 35 and 40, with Utah being the biggest outlier.
                </li>
                <li>
                  There is an inverse correlation between lacking healthcare and median income. As income goes up, so does the % of those with healthcare, while the % of smokers decrease along with rates of obesity.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Generalizations</h3>
            Utah stands out as an outlier:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The lowest % of smokers, youngest median age, relatively low poverty with high median income (not skewed to fewer wealthy individuals).
                </li>
                <li>
                  One would assume that this is attributable to also correlative data of cohesive family units and above average education.
                </li>
              </ul>
            DC and CO:
              <ul> 
                <li>
                  They have very similar rates of obesity and smoking, and tend to maintain about the same distance from each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A detailed breakdown of population demographics would likely lead to some striking similarities.
                </li>
              </ul>
